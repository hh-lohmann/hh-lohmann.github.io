# Coding Maxims

*btw: is "programming" the same as "coding"? are there programs without code?*



## Is "maxim" the right term?

* "guideline": rather abstract, often a collection of aspects
* "principle": rather a starting point than a goal
* "maxim": clearly a goal, seems *verifiable* in "is achieved" or "is not achieved"
